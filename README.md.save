# CMS Hospital Efficiency & Cost Effectiveness Analytics

Operations analytics project using **CMS Provider Data** to identify 
hospitals with
high relative Medicare spending and elevated readmission rates, 
supporting
data-driven operational review and cost-reduction efforts.

---

## Background & Overview

Healthcare systems face pressure to reduce avoidable cost while 
maintaining quality.
This project analyzes **public CMS hospital performance data** to 
surface:

- Hospitals with **higher-than-expected Medicare spending**
- Hospitals with **higher-than-expected readmissions**
- Facilities where **both risks overlap**, creating clear operational 
priority targets

The goal is **clarity over complexity**:  
identify *where to look first* and *why*.

## Architecture

**Flow:**
CMS Raw CSVs → Cleaned Fact Tables → Facility-Level Metrics → 
Executive Watchlist

## Data Sources (CMS)

- **Hospital General Information**
- **Medicare Spending Per Beneficiary (MSPB)**
- **Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP)**

## Executive Summary (One-Click “So What”)

📌 **Key Insight**  
Hospitals that are **simultaneously high-cost and high-readmission** 
represent the
strongest candidates for focused operational review.

📊 **Coverage**
- Total hospitals analyzed: **5,421**
- Hospitals with MSPB data: **2,899**
- Hospitals with Readmissions data: **2,833**
- Hospitals with both metrics: **2,778**

📈 **Method**
- High-cost = MSPB ≥ 75th percentile
- High-readmission = Readmission ratio ≥ 75th percentile
- Ranking uses a **z-scored composite efficiency risk score**
